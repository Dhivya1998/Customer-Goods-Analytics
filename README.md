# Customer-Goods-Analytics

This project is part of the Data Analytics Bootcamp at Codebasics.

## Project Overview

Atliq Hardware, a global leader in rapid growth, initially relied on Excel for data storage. However, as the company expanded,
the limitations of Excel became apparent. Consequently, they opted for MySQL as their database solution. Currently, Atliq utilizes
MySQL to store and manage data. In this project, I leveraged the MySQL database to query and address 14 ad-hoc requests from stakeholders, facilitating data-driven decision-making.
